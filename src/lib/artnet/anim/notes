// Base Animation Class

// should take the:
// - image data
// - the target size,
// - ~~another object for Animation type (which will apply the animation and generate the frames)~~
//          - actually this should be a trait which another animations extend
// - an object to represent artnet target (if the aniamtion is not reusable; no if should be reusable)

// should have a method to play the animation at the target
// - applies animation to get all the frames
// - for each frame, send the data to the target (Frame will have method to send all the data to the target, no need for sharding or anything here)

// NOTE: animation should work as follows
// - generate animation using image library
// - 


/// An animator for ArtNet devices
/// streams various effects to target device
